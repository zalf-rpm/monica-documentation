# MONICA - The Model for Nitrogen and Carbon in Agro-ecosystems

MONICA is a dynamic, process-based simulation model which describes transport and bio-chemical turn-over of carbon, nitrogen and water in agro-ecosystems. On daily time steps the most important processes in soil and plant are modelled mechanistically. They are linked in such way that feed-back relations of the single processes are reproduced as close to nature as possible. MONICA works one dimensional and represents a space of 1 m² surface area and 2 m depth. 

The acronym MONICA is derived from „MOdel of Nitrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agro-ecosystems”.

This Wiki contains information about the software development of MONICA as well as its use.

## History

Some information about the different versions of MONICA can be found here [MONICA versions](wiki/Monica-versions).

## Compile MONICA

How to compile MONICA?[(Windows)](https://github.com/zalf-rpm/monica/wiki/How-to-compile-MONICA-(Windows)) / [(Linux)](https://github.com/zalf-rpm/monica/wiki/How-to-compile-MONICA-(Linux))

## Use MONICA

MONICA can be used in two broad ways, as a standalone commandline application and with scripts which will send jobs to a cloud of MONICA worker processes.

How to "install" MONICA with the current zip version can be found [here](wiki/Installing-accessing-zip-version-of-MONICA-under-Windows).
How to use MONICA as a standalone commandline application is described [here](wiki/How-to-run-standalone-CMD-MONICA). 

To find a description of how to use MONICA on high performance computers or with multiple machines look [here](wiki/How-to-run-HPC-MONICA). Basic information of how MONICA works is assumed in the HPC use case description.

In order to use **MONICA** you have to understand it's configuration file format. This documenation you can find [here](wiki/monica_config_index).
