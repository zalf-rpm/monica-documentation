# Respiration

Maintenance respiration is calculated for the photo period and for darkness using AGROSIM algorithms (Mirschel und Wenkel, 2007):

$` \small M_{photo} = \sum (W_i \cdot m_i) \cdot 2^{a\cdot(T_{photo} - b)} \cdot (2-L_N)`$

$` \small M_{dark} = \sum (W_i \cdot m_i) \cdot 2^{a\cdot(T_{dark} - b)} \cdot L_N`$

$` \small M_{photo} `$	Maintenance respiration during the photo period	$` \small [Pa] `$<br>
$` \small M_{dark}`$	Maintenance respiration in darkness	$` \small [Pa] `$<br>
$` \small W_i `$	Dry mass of organ i	$` \small [kg \, m^{-2}] `$<br>
$` \small m_i `$	Specific maintenance respiration of organ i	$` \small [kg \, m^{-2}] `$<br>
$` \small T_{photo} `$	Mean temperature during the photo period	$` \small [^{\circ} C] `$<br>
$` \small T_{dark} `$	Mean temperature during the dark period	$` \small [^{\circ} C] `$<br>
$` \small a, b `$	Parameters	 <br>
$` \small L_N`$	Normalised day length	$` \small [d] `$<br>

where

$` \small L_N = 2 - \left ( \frac{L_p}{12} \right ) `$

$` \small L_N `$	Normalised day length	$` \small [d] `$<br>
$` \small L_P`$	Photoactive day length	$` \small [d] `$<br>

und

$` \small T_{photo} = T_{max} - \left ( \frac{T_{max} - T_{min}} {4}  \right ) `$

$` \small T_{dark} = T_{min} + \left ( \frac{T_{max} - T_{min}} {4}  \right ) `$

$` \small T_{photo}`$	Mean temperature during the photo period	$` \small [^{\circ} C] `$<br>
$` \small T_{max}`$	Daily maximum air temperature	$` \small [^{\circ} C] `$<br>
$` \small T_{min}`$	Daily minimum air temperature	$` \small [^{\circ} C] `$<br>

Growth respiration is calculated accordingly.

Maintenance respiration is served with priority using assimilates produced by photosynthesis; growth respiration is second in line. Assimilates are assigned to the crop organs according to a partitioning matrix which is organised by the cropâ€™s developmental stages. The crops development in turn is calculated from the sum of degree days and, if applicable, modified for each stage by day length and vernalisation requirement.
