# Nitrogen deficiency

Nitrogen deficiency is indicated as soon as the crop’s tissue N concentration falls below the critical N concentration. The respective reduction factor results from

$`\small \zeta_N = 1-e^{N_m - \left( 5\cdot \frac{N_{act} - N_m} {N_{crit} - N_m}  \right)} `$

$`\small \zeta_N `$	Reduction factor N stress	 <br>
$`\small N_m`$	Minimum N concentration in the plant tissue	$`\small [kg \, N \, kg \, TM^{-1}] `$<br>
$`\small N_{act}`$	Actual N concentration in the plant tissue	$`\small [kg \, N \, kg \, TM^{-1}] `$<br>
$`\small N_{crit}`$	Critical N concentration in the plant tissue	$`\small [kg \, N \, kg \, TM^{-1}] `$<br>

In the case of stress due to drought or nitrogen deficiency acceleration of ontogenesis is assumed for some developmental stages.
