On daily time steps the most important processes in soil and plant are modelled mechanistically. They are linked in such way that feed-back relations of the single processes are reproduced as close to nature as possible. MONICA works one-dimensional and represents a space of 1 m<sup>2</sup> surface area and 2 m depth.</p> <p>The acronym MONICA is derived from \u201cMOdel of NItrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agro-ecosystems\u201d.</p>"},{"location":"#what-can-monica-do","title":"What can MONICA do?","text":"<p>For daily time steps, MONICA calculates all processes that interact with the bio-chemical turn-over of carbon and nitrogen in soil and with their transport in soil, air and plant. A broad range of variables being of interest for the user can be accessed day-by-day. This could be easily measurable items, such as soil moisture, carbon and nitrogen contents, the crop\u2019s biomass, or yield. These quantities are well suited to evaluate the performance of the MONICA simulations. However, MONICA also shows items that can only be quantified with great effort, such as nitrogen mineralisation from crop residues or organic fertilisers, NH<sub>3</sub>-, N<sub>2</sub>O-, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from soil, denitrification, potential groundwater recharge, crop evapotranspiration, or the leaching of nitrates into deeper soil layers.</p>"},{"location":"#which-processes-are-described","title":"Which processes are described?","text":"<p>MONICA describes processes in the soil\u2013plant system and the energy and matter exchange with the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Using daily weather data, it calculates the soil temperature for single discrete layers in the soil. The movement of water in the soil is modelled using a capacity approach. This approach assumes that water that cannot be stored in a soil layer will be passed on to the adjacent layer below. The layer\u2019s storage capacity and its percolation rate are governed by its texture and soil organic matter content. Evaporation and water uptake by the root influence the water budget. If groundwater is accessible, capillary water can rise into the root zone.</p> <p>Soil organic matter turnover is based on conceptual carbon pools, representing labile and stabilised carbon, each with two different turnover rates. Alongside, two populations of microbes, r- and K-strategists are represented, summing up to six organic carbon pools in total. Efficiency parameters determine CO2 losses from microbial turnover, and the C-to-N stoichiometry requires nitrogen to be released as ammonium (ammonification), accordingly. Through nitrification ammonium is turned intro nitrate which may move with the water through the soil.</p> <p>If oxygen is deficient, nitrate can be transformed into atmospheric nitrogen (denitrification), a process during which the greenhouse gas N<sub>2</sub>O is produced. The microorganisms facilitating these processes and producing CO<sub>2</sub> from their metabolism are also simulated. When organic fertilisers are applied, gaseous NH<sub>3</sub> is set free. Furthermore, also urea fertiliser hydrolyses in the soil and releases NH<sub>3</sub>.</p> <p>The crop\u2019s biomass increases according to the daily radiation and temperature. A target and a critical nitrogen concentration are calculated for the plant tissue. The first serves the calculation of nitrogen uptake from the soil, while the second is used to determine nitrogen deficiency. In the latter case, similar to drought stress, the crop\u2019s daily growth increment will be reduced. In daily time steps the root grows into depth. The calculated root biomass is distributed to the discrete soil layers accordingly. The calculation of water and nitrogen uptake by the plant considers this distribution and consumes from the respective soil layers. </p> <p>At harvest, crop residues remain. They are decomposed and contribute to soil organic matter pools, nitrogen mineralisation, and CO<sub>2</sub> release. Every organic material has its own properties which determine its decay. That way a lettuce leaf will be mineralised much faster than wheat straw. Currently, MONICA is able to simulate eight different crops.</p>"},{"location":"#monicas-crop-growth-concept","title":"MONICA\u2019s crop growth concept","text":"<p>The crop growth concept of MONICA is based on the calculation of assimilate production from radiation using a simplified Farquhar approach that allows considering the effect of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis and transpiration. The efficiency of carbohydrate production is dependent on temperature. The virtual crop\u2019s development from seed to harvest maturity is determined using the accumulating temperature. For each developmental stage, the distribution of carbohydrates within the crop is continuously adjusted. In early stages root and leaf growth is promoted, while shoot and fruit growth will be increasingly supported at later stages. The distributed carbohydrates will be converted into dry matter biomass and \u2013 in the case of leaves \u2013 also in leaf area. In turn, leaf area, as the main location for photosynthesis, finds its way into the calculation of carbohydrate production.</p> <p>The amount of dry matter assigned to the root is distributed down the soil profile according to an empirical formula. The current rooting depth is depending on soil texture, but also on the crop itself. Further on, root length density limits the root\u2019s ability to take up water and nitrogen.  </p> <p>From leaf area, the degree of soil coverage is estimated, which in turn determines the fraction of transpiration from total evapotranspiration. Actual evapotranspiration is calculated relative to a cut grass crop, using crop-specific coefficients. The resulting water loss is then \u2013 a sufficient supply assumed \u2013 taken from the respective soil layers according to the root distribution. In case water supply is insufficient and falls below a specific threshold value, crop growth will be reduced. This also applies in the case of nitrogen supply from soil being insufficient for maintaining the N concentration in the crop tissue above a critical level.</p> <p>At harvest, marketable parts of the crop are removed and the remaining residues are allocated to conceptual organic matter pools in the soil. Nitrogen in the crop is then divided between marketable yield and crop residues.</p>"},{"location":"#applications","title":"Applications","text":"<p>MONICA has been applied so far in a range of research projects </p> <ul> <li>The LandCaRe 2020 project focused on the development of a knowledge platform on which stakeholders can access information on the expected impact of climate change on agriculture in Germany (BMBF Funding Focus klimazwei).</li> <li>In the CarBioCial project, three regions along a land use gradient in Southern Amazonia (Brazil) are currently analysed to derive recommendations for a carbon-neutral land management under climate change conditions in Brazil (BMBF Funding Focus Sustainable Land Management).</li> <li>Within the EVA2, project crop rotations for energy production are currently grown on different sites across Germany.

HERMES is a pure nitrogen model. It had to be modified to also support research questions on carbon dynamics under climate change. The simple algorithm for the calculation of nitrogen mineralisation from soil organic matter was replaced by a more comprehensive one, which was taken from the Danish DAISY model (Abrahamsen and Hansen, 2000). It calculates the carbon turn-over and derives nitrogen dynamics from it. This approach also considers soil microbial biomass dynamics.

Finally, the new model, which was given the name MONICA, was equipped with automatically triggered fertilising and irrigation routines. They enable MONICA to run in long-term scenarios without having to adjust the virtual crop\u2019s management to gradually changing conditions.</p>"},{"location":"#monicas-predecessor-the-hermes-model","title":"MONICA\u2019s predecessor: the HERMES model","text":"<p>The HERMES model (Kersebaum 1989) was the first simulation model for the year-round simulation of N dynamics in agricultural sites developed in Germany. It uses a generic, photosynthesis-driven crop model, built on the archetype SUCROS (Van Keulen et al. 1982). This enables HERMES to consider a broad range of crops. In general, the process model comprises rather simple algorithms and requires easy-to-access input data only.</p> <p>However, HERMES used some input information that was specific for Germany, such as the German soil classification system and Haude\u2019s evapotranspiration factors. For this reason, it was not much used by international colleagues. In Germany, however, HERMES was applied in many case studies, including regional applications in combination with a geo-information system. More recent releases include alternative evapotranspiration algorithms and enable a less restrictive parameterisation of the soil. This version was also applied outside Europe (Kersebaum et al. 2008). The HERMES model is considered the heart of MONICA.</p> <p>Including other models and algorithms. There were a few more functionalities that HERMES was lacking, and that were gradually added to MONICA. One of them was the soil temperature module, which was borrowed from the 4C forest simulation model (Bugmann et al., 1997). From the THESEUS modelling toolbox (Wegehenkel, 2000), the control of the water flux via an empirical conductivity parameter was added. This allowed the addition of a module for soil water freezing, thawing and for a snow layer. Groundwater dynamics were introduced, enabling the simulation of ascending water from surface-near groundwater (Khaledi et al., 2024b).</p> <p>The crop module was enhanced by integrating a more sophisticated plant physiology module from ARCWHEAT1 (Mitchell et al., 1995). It allows to simulate the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on both the photosynthesis and the transpiration (Nendel et al., 2009). For this purpose, the Penman-Monteith equation for evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 1998) was introduced to MONICA, linking photosynthesis and transpiration via the stomata.  Root growth, as the part of MONICA linking the soil and plant part, has been taken from the EU-Rotate_N model (Rahn et al., 2010), but remaining with the 1D approach. The representation of rooting systems with different morphology originates from Pedersen et al. (2009) for annual or from Nendel and Kersebaum (2004) for perennial crops</p>"},{"location":"#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Kersebaum, K.C.

The calibration procedure also included crops grown experimentally under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. The calibrated MONICA simulations yielded a median normalised mean absolute error (nMAE) of 0.20 across all observed target variables (n=42) and a median Willmott's Index of Agreement (d) of 0.91 (median modelling efficiency (ME): 0.75). Although the crop biomass, habitus and soil moisture variables were all within an acceptable range, the model often underperformed for variables related to nitrogen.

Based on the convincing performance of the model under uncalibrated conditions, MONICA can be regarded as a suitable simulation model for use in regional applications.

For each developmental stage, the distribution of carbohydrates within the crop is continuously adjusted. In early stages, root and leaf growth are promoted, while shoot and fruit growth will be increasingly supported at later stages.

While slowly decomposing parts of the plant material are assigned a constant C-to-N ratio, the C-to-N ratio of the rapidly decomposing parts varies in relation to the plant\u2019s total N content as:</p> \\[CN(AOM_f) = \\frac{C_{AOM} \\cdot f(AOM_f)} {N_{AOM} - \\left(  \\frac{C_{AOM} \\cdot f(AOM_s)} {CN(AOM_s)}   \\right)}\\] <p>where \\(CN\\) denotes the C-to-N ratio, \\(C_{AOM}\\) the C concentration, and \\(N_{AOM}\\) the N concentration in the added organic matter (AOM). \\(f\\) is the part of AOM which is assigned rapidly (\\(AOM_f\\)) or slowly (AOMs) decomposing fractions. The decomposition rate coefficients of both pools are constant (Abrahamsen and Hansen, 2000).</p> <p>C-to-N ratios and partitioning coefficients for different crop residues were determined using stepwise chemical digestion (Jensen et al., 2005). Parameters for N release from manure and slurry were taken from the DAISY model (Abrahamsen and Hansen, 2000). Crop residues having a wide C-to-N ratio induce immobilisation of mineral N in soil. In the case of insufficient mineral N being available in soil, all decomposition processes with a negative N balance cease.</p> <p>N volatilisation of manure and slurry is described using an empirical function of the ALFAM model (S\u00f8gaard et al., 2002). Another function to describe the dependency of gaseous N emmissions from soil pH was derived from data published by He et al. (1999). A Michaelis-Menten kinetic was fitted to their data, and the relation between pH and N volatilisation half-life was normalised to pH 7.0.</p> <p>Urea hydrolysis and the respective gaseous N losses after application of urea-based fertilisers are calculated using algorithms of the AMOVOL model (Sadeghi, 1988). It considers the temperature-dependent equilibrium between ammonium ions in solution and gaseous ammonia, as well as effects of soil organic matter content, soil temperature, and soil moisture content on hydrolysis. The atmospheric resistance finally governs the loss of gaseous ammonia from soil.</p>"},{"location":"model_science/soil_processes/organic_matter_turn-over/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Abrahamsen, P., Hansen, S., 2000.

It allows to send easily messages which can contain arbitrary information between connected parties (nodes/programs/etc).</p> <p>In the case of MONICA that means that a ZeroMQ message is actually a JSON string, which contains all the information MONICA needs to run a full simulation. This includes all (climate-) data, soil- and crop-parameters as well as the configuration of the particular simulation. One possible exception at the moment are climate data, which optionally can be read by the MONICA server process itself if the path to a climate .csv file is given. This has been done for performance reasons.</p> <p><code>monica-zmq-server</code> can thus be treated as a stateless process, which receives via ZeroMQ messages/jobs, runs a single simulation and returns a result message. This result message is again a JSON string which contains the results requested by the configuration in the <code>sim/output/events section</code> of the received message.</p> <p>ZeroMQ makes it easy to connect processes/programs/scripts using a message-passing system. Usually, if two processes have to communicate, there will be a server-like part and a client-like part. The server part being usually the more stable one (like a normal webserver), whereas clients come and go, connect and disconnect. In order to communicate, both parties have to agree on a supported transport protocol (in our cases here TCP), an IP address or DNS name, and a port.</p> <p>Thus when a client connects to an URL like: <code>tcp://my-domain.de:6666</code>. It will tell the ZeroMQ library used by MONICA to use the TCP protocol to transport the messages and connect to a server listening on port <code>6666</code> at domain <code>my-domain.de</code>. The server would do something called bind to network interfaces at a given port and with a transport protocol. So <code>tcp://*:6666</code> would be the counterpart to the client address, which tells ZeroMQ to use TCP as transport protocol, bind to all available network interfaces (*) and port <code>6666</code>.</p> <p>Because we're using ZeroMQ to transport our messages you don't have to care if the client or the server is there first. If one of the connecting parties starts up it will try to connect to the other party. Also ZeroMQ allows n:m connections, if it makes sense. This means multiple clients can at the same time be connected to multiple servers. This is especially relevant if the processes are connected in pipeline mode, where one process will receive data (input) on one port and send results (output) on to other connected processes on other port(s).

There will be a producer process (usually a Python script) which creates work (simulations) which are being send to an intermediate process (called a ZeroMQ proxy), which distributes the received messages (simulation jobs) amongst connected (to the proxy) <code>monica-zmq-server</code> processses. Each <code>monica-zmq-server</code> process waits for simulation jobs (messages), runs the simulation and sends the simulation result on to another ZeroMQ proxy which collects all results and forwards them to a connected consuming/aggregating process (usually a Python script). Producer and consumer as well as the MONICA processes (client-like) connect to the ZeroMQ proxy processes, which play the stable server-like role in this setup.</p> <p>This simple setup allows to start an arbitrary/necessary amount of MONICA processes to handle the workload created by the producer process. In general there could be multiple producers connected to the input side proxy as well as multiple consumers to the output side proxy. But while conceptually it's easy to add more producers, it might be more difficult to have more consumers (to handle aggregation) as usually aggregation can't be separated easily. Also in normal setups often the producer process can become a bottleneck as a single process has to create all the simulation setups for N MONICAs.</p> <p>For more information and details, please look up the ZeroMQ documentation.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/Installation_and_Setup/monica_server/#running-single-server-in-request-reply-mode","title":"Running single server in Request-Reply mode","text":"<p>The simplest way to use MONICA in server mode is to execute by</p> <pre><code>C:\\&gt; monica-zmq-server -s\n</code></pre> <p>This will start monica-zmq-server and will listen on all network interface on port <code>6666</code> by default.

In theory one could start a producer process (e.g. a Python script) as a server-like process (e.g. binding to <code>tcp://*:6666</code>) and let many <code>monica-zmq-servers</code> connect (e.g. via connecting to <code>tcp://localhost:6666</code>) to the producer process. The same could happen for the output side, where a consumer process binds to tcp://*:7777 and all MONICAS connect to <code>tcp://localhost:7777</code>. Then ZeroMQ would take care to distribute the work from the single producer to many MONICAs and send all results on to a single consumer.</p> <p>Practically letting play the producer/consumer play the stable server-like is not the best solution, as these are actually the mostly changing part in such a setup and it will always take a few seconds until all MONICAs automatically have been connected to a newly started producer and consumer. For that reason it makes sense to introduce into the setup two stable processes (proxies) as can be seen on the picture in the ZeroMQ section, which are for instance running steadily on a high performance cluster, playing the server-like part and bind to the network interfaces and let an arbitrary amount of MONICAs connect to them. This network/cloud of MONICAs is stable and waiting for simulation jobs at the proxy gatekeepers input ports.
