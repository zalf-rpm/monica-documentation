# Oxygen deficiency

Oxygen deficiency in the rooted soil volume is determined by the ratio of the actual and the critical air content in the soil. It is assumed that decreasing oxygen concentration in the remaining air volume leads to maximum deficiency effects after four days.

$$\zeta_O = 1- \left( \frac{t_{anox}} {4} \right)  \cdot (1 - \zeta_{O_{max}})$$

$\zeta_O$ Reduction factor oxygen stress <br>
$t_{anox}$ Time under oxygen deficiency (max = 4) $[d]$<br>
$\zeta_{O_{max}}$ Maximum oxygen deficit <br>

where

$$\zeta_{O_{max}} = \left( \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_{crit}} \right)    \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \varepsilon < \varepsilon_{crit}$$

$\zeta_{O_{max}}$ Maximum oxygen deficit <br>
$\varepsilon$ Air volume in the soil $[m^3 m^{-3}]$<br>
$\varepsilon_{crit}$ Plant-specific critical soil oxygen content $[m^3 m^{-3}]$<br>

Oxygen stress reduces root water uptake.
