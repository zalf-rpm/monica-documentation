# Nitrogen deficiency

Nitrogen deficiency is indicated as soon as the cropâ€™s tissue N concentration falls below the critical N concentration. The respective reduction factor results from:

$$\zeta_N = 1-e^{N_m - \left( 5\cdot \frac{N_{act} - N_m} {N_{crit} - N_m}  \right)}$$

$\zeta_N$ Reduction factor N stress<br>
$N_m$ Minimum N concentration in the plant tissue $[kg \, N \, kg \, TM^{-1}]$<br>
$N_{act}$ Actual N concentration in the plant tissue $[kg \, N \, kg \, TM^{-1}]$<br>
$N_{crit}$ Critical N concentration in the plant tissue	$[kg \, N \, kg \, TM^{-1}]$<br>

In the case of stress due to drought or nitrogen deficiency, acceleration of ontogenesis is assumed for some developmental stages.
