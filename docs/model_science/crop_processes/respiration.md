# Respiration

Maintenance respiration is calculated for the photo period and for darkness using AGROSIM algorithms (Mirschel und Wenkel, 2007):

$$M_{photo} = \sum (W_i \cdot m_i) \cdot 2^{a\cdot(T_{photo} - b)} \cdot (2-L_N)$$

$$M_{dark} = \sum (W_i \cdot m_i) \cdot 2^{a\cdot(T_{dark} - b)} \cdot L_N$$

$M_{photo}$ Maintenance respiration during the photo period	$[Pa]$<br>
$M_{dark}$ Maintenance respiration in darkness $[Pa]$<br>
$W_i$ Dry mass of organ $i$	$[kg \, m^{-2}]$<br>
$m_i$ Specific maintenance respiration of organ $i$	$[kg \, m^{-2}]$<br>
$T_{photo}$	Mean temperature during the photo period $[^{\circ} C]$<br>
$T_{dark}$ Mean temperature during the dark period $[^{\circ} C]$<br>
$a, b$ Parameters<br>
$L_N$ Normalised day length	$[d]$<br>

where

$$L_N = 2 - \left ( \frac{L_p}{12} \right )$$

$L_N$ Normalised day length	$[d]$<br>
$L_P$ Photoactive day length $[d]$<br>

and

$$T_{photo} = T_{max} - \left ( \frac{T_{max} - T_{min}} {4}  \right )$$

$$T_{dark} = T_{min} + \left ( \frac{T_{max} - T_{min}} {4}  \right )$$

$T_{photo}$	Mean temperature during the photo period $[^{\circ} C]$<br>
$T_{max}$ Daily maximum air temperature	$[^{\circ} C]$<br>
$T_{min}$ Daily minimum air temperature	$[^{\circ} C]$<br>

Growth respiration is calculated accordingly.

Maintenance respiration is served with priority using assimilates produced by photosynthesis; growth respiration is second in line. Assimilates are assigned to the crop organs according to a partitioning matrix which is organised by the cropâ€™s developmental stages. The crop's development, in turn, is calculated from the sum of degree days and, if applicable, modified for each stage by day length and vernalisation requirement.
